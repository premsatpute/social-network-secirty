Aim : 
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting phishing URLs to enhance security measures in social networks.


Objective :
A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. The objective of this notebook is to collect data & extract the selective features form the URLs.

1)	To collect and preprocess a comprehensive dataset of URLs, including features indicative of phishing activities.

2)	To engineer new features from the URL data that can improve the predictive performance of the machine learning model.


3)	To evaluate various machine learning models and optimize the best-performing model for phishing URL prediction.
